## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Overview

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ extension.ts     # Main extension entry point (to be modularized)
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/           # Authentication and token management (planned)
â”œâ”€â”€ analytics/      # Event logging and digests (planned)
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/            # Status bar and activity panel (planned)
â””â”€â”€ storage/       # Backup and recovery (planned)
```

### Key Principles

1. **Privacy First**: Never collect actual code content
2. **Reliability**: Handle offline scenarios gracefully
3. **Performance**: Minimize impact on VS Code performance
4. **User Experience**: Keep notifications minimal and relevant

### Security Considerations

- Always validate and sanitize file paths
- Use VS Code's SecretStorage for sensitive data
- Never log sensitive information
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web requests

## Release Process

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a git tag: `git tag v1.0.X`
4. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.X`
5. GitHub Actions will build and create a release
