## üîí Privacy & Data Collection

**We take your privacy seriously.** Here's exactly what Frolic does:

### What We Collect (Only When You Sign In)
- **File activity**: Which files you edit, programming languages used, lines of code changed
- **Coding patterns**: When you code, how long you spend on different files, project structure
- **Learning behavior patterns**: 
  - Rapid undo/redo sequences (struggle detection)
  - Long pauses between coding actions (thinking time analysis)
  - Frequent file switching patterns (context switching behavior)
  - Error and debugging patterns (diagnostic events from VS Code)
- **AI collaboration patterns**: Detection of AI-assisted code generation and human refinement patterns
- **Session characteristics**: Coding session duration, intensity, and focus patterns
- **No personal code**: We never collect the actual content of your code, only metadata about your activity
- **Account info**: Name and email address (only if you sign up for coding recaps)

### Specific Events We Track
- **File operations**: Open, close, save, edit events
- **VS Code diagnostics**: Error/warning events (not the error content, just patterns)
- **Timing patterns**: Pauses between actions, session duration, editing intensity
- **Undo/redo actions**: Frequency and patterns (struggle detection)
- **File switching**: Context switching behavior between files
- **AI detection**: Patterns suggesting AI-assisted code generation
- **Window focus**: When VS Code gains/loses focus for session boundary detection

### What We DON'T Collect
- ‚ùå **Actual code content** - Your code never leaves your machine
- ‚ùå **Keystrokes or specific text** - We don't track what you type, only that you typed
- ‚ùå **File contents** - Only file paths and metadata, never the actual code
- ‚ùå **Error message content** - Only that errors occurred, not what they said
- ‚ùå **Personal information** - Beyond name/email for signed-in users
- ‚ùå **Sensitive data** - No passwords, API keys, or confidential information

### Your Control
- **Logging is optional** - Disable anytime with `frolic.enableLogging: false`
- **Local-first design** - All data stays on your machine until you sign in
- **Data deletion** - Contact us anytime to delete your cloud data
- **Open source** - Extension code is public for full transparency

### Data Usage
- Generate personalized coding insights and recaps
- Improve the extension based on anonymous usage patterns
- **Never sold or shared** with third parties

For complete details, see our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY.md).
